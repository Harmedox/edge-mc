We are grateful for your interest in joining the KCP-Edge community and making a positive impact. Whether you&rsquo;re raising issues, enhancing documentation, fixing bugs, or developing new features, your contributions are essential to our success.</p><p>To get started, kindly read through this document and familiarize yourself with our code of conduct. If you have any inquiries, please feel free to reach out to us on <a href=https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C021U8WSAFK>Slack</a>.</p><p>We can&rsquo;t wait to collaborate with you!</p><h2 id=contributing-code>Contributing Code</h2><h3 id=prerequisites>Prerequisites</h3><p><a href=https://golang.org/doc/install>Install Go</a> 1.19+.</p><p>Check out our <a href=/docs/getting-started/quickstart/>Quickstart Guide</a></p><h3 id=issues>Issues</h3><p>Prioritization for pull requests is given to those that address and resolve existing GitHub issues. Utilize the available issue labels to identify meaningful and relevant issues to work on.</p><p>If you believe that there is a need for a fix and no existing issue covers it, feel free to create a new one.</p><p>As a new contributor, we encourage you to start with issues labeled as good first issues.</p><p>Your assistance in improving documentation is highly valued, regardless of your level of experience with the project.</p><p>To claim an issue that you are interested in, kindly leave a comment on the issue and request the maintainers to assign it to you.</p><h3 id=committing>Committing</h3><p>We encourage all contributors to adopt <a href=https://www.futurelearn.com/info/blog/telling-stories-with-your-git-history>best practices in git commit management</a> to facilitate efficient reviews and retrospective analysis. Your git commits should provide ample context for reviewers and future codebase readers.</p><p>A recommended format for final commit messages is as follows:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>{Short Title}: {Problem this commit is solving and any important contextual information} {issue number if applicable}
</code></pre><h3 id=pull-requests>Pull Requests</h3><p>When submitting a pull request, clear communication is appreciated. This can be achieved by providing the following information:</p><ul><li>Detailed description of the problem you are trying to solve, along with links to related GitHub issues</li><li>Explanation of your solution, including links to any design documentation and discussions</li><li>Information on how you tested and validated your solution</li><li>Updates to relevant documentation and examples, if applicable</li></ul><p>The pull request template has been designed to assist you in communicating this information effectively.</p><p>Smaller pull requests are typically easier to review and merge than larger ones. If your pull request is big, it is always recommended to collaborate with the maintainers to find the best way to divide it.</p><p>Approvers will review your PR within a business day. A PR requires both an /lgtm and then an /approve in order to get merged. You may /approve your own PR but you may not /lgtm it. Automation will add the PR it to the OpenShift PR merge queue. The OpenShift Tide bot will automatically merge your work when it is available.</p><p>Congratulations! Your pull request has been successfully merged! üëè</p><p>If you have any questions about contributing, don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out to us on the KCP-dev <a href=https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C021U8WSAFK>Slack channel</a>.</p><h2 id=testing-locally>Testing Locally</h2><p>Check out our <a href=/docs/getting-started/quickstart/>quickstart guide</a> to install a local KCP server and install the KCP-Edge components</p><h2 id=licensing>Licensing</h2><p>KCP-Edge is <a href=LICENSE>Apache 2.0 licensed</a> and we accept contributions via
